  ## stay in the household
  ## journey outside
  ## be admitted to hospital etsq

  ## they can move to a different SA2
  ## or they can move for a daily activity

  ## if they go out for work
  ## their destination is their dzn of work
  ## unless they are work in a hospital, school, or aged care

  ## if they go out for school as a pupil
  ## (only occurs if they are a child)
  ## they go to a school in their SA2

  ## if they go out to purchase groceries
  ## the destination is stochastic
  ## Other places by predefined times
  ## per year

  ## Only interested in magnitude of interactions
  ## (above a certain limit?)

  ## Process is
  ## Loop over each day
  ### Loop over each person
  #### identify their places that day
  ### add up all the interactions
  ### sleep!
  ### next day
