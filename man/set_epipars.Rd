\arguments{
\item{incubation_distribution}{One of `"pois"`, `"lnorm"`, and `"dirac"`,
whether the incubation period is Poisson, log-normal, or constant.}

\item{incubation_mean}{The intended average of the distribution, must be
positive, and a whole number for `"pois"` and `"diract"`.}

\item{incubation_sigma}{A measure of the spread of the distribution.}

\item{illness_distribution, illness_mean, illness_sigma}{As for \code{incubation} above.}

\item{r_distribution}{The distribution of the number of infections from each
infected person, one of `"cauchy"`, `"lnorm"`, `"pois"`, or `"dirac"`.}

\item{r_location, r_scale}{Parameters for \code{r_distribution}. The number of
infections \strong{per day}.}

\item{r_schools_distribution, r_schools_location, r_schools_scale}{Variables
particular for schools.}

\item{r_supermarket_location, r_supermarket_scale}{Variables particular
for supermarket.}

\item{resistance_threshold}{An integer in \code{[0, 1000]}, the resistance
required to not be infected. A value of 0
means no-one will be infected; a value of 1000 means everyone will.}

\item{p_asympto}{A number in \code{[0, 1]}, the proportion of cases that
are asymptomatic.}

\item{p_critical}{A number in \code{[0, 1]}, the proportion of
\strong{symptomatic} patients that require ICU.}

\item{p_death}{A number in \code{[0, 1]}, the proportion of
\strong{critical cases} that die.}
}
\value{
A list of the components, plus an entry \code{CHECKED} having the
value \code{TRUE}.

\description{
Used to supply epidemiological parameters to the main
simulate function, with defaults.
